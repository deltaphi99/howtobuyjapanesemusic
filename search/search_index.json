Your parcel is carried speedily through Japan's mail system, gets on a plane to your country, and then gets handed off to your national postal service (e.g. USPS), who will treat it as an express delivery. It comes with full tracking from end-to-end. EMS is therefore pretty fast and reliable (on average, it takes about 7 days to deliver), but it's relatively expensive. Airmail Small Packet/ePacket Is a decent budget shipping method for parcels weighing under 2kg. Your parcel is only tracked while it's in Japan; as soon as it leaves the country, it's untracked. I've found this method to be quite reliable, ordinarily taking only a week to deliver to me in Australia. Occasionally it takes a little longer, but it always arrives within two or three weeks; I've never had a lost Small Packet/ePacket delivery. I definitely recommend this method if you're regularly shipping small parcels out of Japan, as it saves a lot of money over tracked methods like EMS, and is usually almost as fast. Courier shipping (DHL / FedEx / UPS) Courier companies are great, as they're always express, fully tracked, and usually offer more personalised services. In some cases, they can be much more expensive than EMS, but in other cases, they can be cheaper! (this is because couriers calculates prices differently from how Japan Post does it) Definitely go with the courier company if you find that it's cheaper than EMS and you don't want to use Small Packet/ePacket. I believe Amazon Japan uses DHL by default for most countries, and offers a special rate that's almost as cheap as budget methods like SAL. SAL (Economy Air) Usually the cheapest shipping method for parcels bigger than 2kg. I don't really recommend it, as it's totally untracked and can be very unreliable. Back when I used SAL, I found that it took 2 or 3 weeks on average to deliver, but it sometimes took longer, reaching up to 2 months in extreme cases. And of course, because it's untracked and kind of erratic, there's a higher chance that your parcel will be damaged or even lost in transit. Frankly, there's not really any reason to use SAL unless you're irrationally cheap, as EMS and Small Packet/ePacket will give you much better value for your money.","title":"Shipping Methods"},{"location":"shippingmethods/#shipping-methods","text":"","title":"Shipping Methods"},{"location":"shippingmethods/#ems-express-mail-service","text":"Is the express international method offered by Japan Post.
